--  1. Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
-- generated revenue by each pizza type / total sales * 100

select pizza_types.category, round(sum(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price)/ (select 
round(sum(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price), 2) as total_sales
from order_details join pizzas
on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id) * 100,2 )  as revenue

from pizza_types join pizzas
on pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
join order_details
on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
group by pizza_types.category order by revenue desc;


-- 2.Analyze the cumulative revenue(CR) generated over time.

--  d1 R 300 >> CR 300
--  d2 R 400 >> CR 700
--  d3 R 300 >> CR 1000
-- sum of revenue based on dates

select date,

--  3. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.
